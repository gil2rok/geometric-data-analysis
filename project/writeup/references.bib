    abstract = "{We introduce a distance-based phylogeny reconstruction method called “weighted neighbor joining,” or “Weighbor” for short. As in neighbor joining, two taxa are joined in each iteration; however, the Weighbor criterion for choosing a pair of taxa to join takes into account that errors in distance estimates are exponentially larger for longer distances. The criterion embodies a likelihood function on the distances, which are modeled as correlated Gaussian random variables with different means and variances, computed under a probabilistic model for sequence evolution. The Weighbor criterion consists of two terms, an additivity term and a positivity term, that quantify the implications of joining the pair. The first term evaluates deviations from additivity of the implied external branches, while the second term evaluates confidence that the implied internal branch has a positive branch length. Compared with maximum-likelihood phylogeny reconstruction, Weighbor is much faster, while building trees that are qualitatively and quantitatively similar. Weighbor appears to be relatively immune to the “long branches attract” and “long branch distracts” drawbacks observed with neighbor joining, BIONJ, and parsimony.}",

abstract = {A homing guide RNA (hgRNA) that directs CRISPR-Cas9 to its own DNA locus can diversify its sequence and act as an expressed genetic barcode. Kalhor et al. engineered a mouse line carrying 60 independent loci of hgRNAs, thus generating a large number of unique barcodes in various embryonic and extraembryonic tissues in fully developed mice. This method demonstrates lineage tracing from the very first branches of the development tree up to organogenesis events and was used to elucidate embryonic brain patterning. Science, this issue p. eaat9804 Multiple, independent barcoding elements enable lineage tracing in the whole mouse embryo during brain development and patterning. In vivo barcoding using nuclease-induced mutations is a powerful approach for recording biological information, including developmental lineages; however, its application in mammalian systems has been limited. We present in vivo barcoding in the mouse with multiple homing guide RNAs that each generate hundreds of mutant alleles and combine to produce an exponential diversity of barcodes. Activation upon conception and continued mutagenesis through gestation resulted in developmentally barcoded mice wherein information is recorded in lineage-specific mutations. We used these recordings for reliable post hoc reconstruction of the earliest lineages and investigation of axis development in the brain. Our results provide an enabling and versatile platform for in vivo barcoding and lineage tracing in a mammalian model system.}}
