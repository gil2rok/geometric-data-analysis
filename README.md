# Geometric Data Analysis

The work of Gilad Turok for [COMS 4995] Geometric Data Analysis with Professor Andrew Blumberg in Spring of 2023.

1. **HW1:** compare clustering algorithms: $k$-means, $k$-medians, single-linkage clustering, spectral clustering with graphs constructed by $k$ nearest-neighbors and the Gaussian/RBF kernel.
2. **HW2:** on multiple datasets, implement and compare dimensionality reduction algorithms: IsoMap, Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), and Laplacian Eigenmaps.

    Prove multiple properties of manifolds: enumerate a space that is not a manifold; show that for any point $m \in \mathcal{M}$ on a manifold, a chart $\theta$ can be constructed such that $\theta(m)=0$; explicate coordinate patches and transition functions for the circle using charts defined by the angle and projections to the axes; prove that solving the MDS matrix factorization problem $A=U \Lambda U^T$ for $m << n$ points approximates the true solution.

3. **HW3:**
